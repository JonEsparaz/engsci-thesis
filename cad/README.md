# CAD files

Files:
- `Modified_Tee_Joint_Approximation.stl`: approximate representation of a _modified_ [Thick-Wall PVC Inline Tee Reducer, 1 Socket Female x 1/2 Socket Female](https://www.mcmaster.com/4881K142/); top connection cut off using a hacksaw and widened using a file. 
- `Turbidity_Probe_Approximation.stl`: approximate representation of the turbidity sensor probe.
- `Custom_Turbidity_Mount.stl`: custom mount used to affix the turbidity sensor to the modified tee joint via u-bolts; fabricated using an Onyx One 3D printer from Markforged.
- `Turbidity_Sensor_Fit_Test.stl`: combination of modified tee joint, turbidity sensor probe, custom turbidity sensor mount, rubber o-ring, and steel u-bolts to test theoretical fit in CAD.
- `Turbidity_Sensor_Fit_Test_Cross_Section.stl`: cross-sectional view of previous file.

CAD files for the [rubber o-ring](https://www.mcmaster.com/1302N001/) and [steel u-bolts](https://www.mcmaster.com/8880T88/) can be downloaded from McMaster-Carr.
